            <p style="font-style:oblique;">Women empowerment in India cannot be compared with that in other countries. 
                Women were highly respected in the Vedic ages. The focus on women’s education was never absent. 
                The word ‘sahadharmini’ was known from the Vedic days. Sahadharmini means - equal partner. 
                It is thus very clear that women in India in ancient days enjoyed respect, education and reverence.

            <h2 style ="color:rgb(221, 9, 9); font-style: italic; font-size: xx-large;">Inequality and the Way Forward :</h2>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Today, more than ever, women are enjoying freedom. They can decide on their own. 
                However, there is a long way to go. Women must protest against the use of religion to suppress them. 
                Not all military positions are open to females. There is a wage gap in the film industry, in sports and normal jobs. 
                The women need to use their hard-earned power to banish all the injustices that they have been facing for time immemorial.
